# Movie Rating Prediction Model
This repository contains code for a movie rating prediction model developed using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about users, movies, and their ratings.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this model is sourced from three separate dat files: `movies.dat`, `ratings.dat`, and `users.dat`. The data includes information about movie names, categories, user ratings, demographics, and more.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, renaming columns, and creating new features such as age groups. Categorical variables like 'Gender' and 'Category' are handled appropriately.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualizations are used to explore the age distribution of users, overall user ratings, and viewership of specific movies. Various plots and charts are created to gain insights into the dataset.

## Model Training
The machine learning model is trained using different algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. Features such as 'MovieId', 'Age', and 'Occupation' are used for training.

## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using accuracy metrics on both the training and test sets. A comparison of different models is provided to assess their performance.
